# [KeyRevolution](https://alexarchibeque.github.io/KeyRevolution/)

Key Revolution is a game based off the popular rhythm game Dance Dance Revolution. 
It is a game where i practice my vanilla Javascript HTML and CSS with the idea being I use as little Libraries, api's or outside programs as possible.

### Technologies Used

For KeyRevolution, as stated above, I used vanilla Javascript, HTML5, and CSS as well as a couple ease of life technologies.

Those being: 

**Webpack**

**Babel**

**File-Loader**
